                <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
                <li>2 bay leaves</li>
                <li>6 chicken thighs, skin-on</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine shallots, garlic, ginger, lemongrass, and lime leaves in a food processor or blender, and grind into a very fine paste.</li>
                <li>Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet and transfer in the mixture from the food processor. Spread out into an even layer. Sprinkle over the coriander, cumin, turmeric, white pepper, and salt. Cook, stirring, until the mixture starts to caramelize onto the bottom of the pan and has become very fragrant, about 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add sambal, brown sugar, soy sauce, chicken broth, and bay leaves, and use a spatula to scrape the bottom of the pan to deglaze. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>With skin side up, make 3 cuts into the center of each thigh, perpendicular to the bone, about 1/2-inch apart. Place chicken into the sauce, skin side down, and reduce the heat to between low and medium-low.</li>
                <li>Baste the top of chicken with sauce. Cover; simmer for 15 minutes. Uncover; turn thighs over. Cook for another 15 minutes, basting occasionally.</li>
                <li>Continue to cook, tossing occasionally, until thighs are tender but not falling off the bone, and sauce has reduced and become very thick. If chicken is finished cooking before sauce is reduced, remove the chicken to a plate, set aside, and continue to reduce the sauce a few minutes more. Reduce heat to low plac;e chicken back in until heated through.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, prepare a charcoal grill for medium-high heat. Grill chicken over charcoal, turning and repositioning often, or until about half of the surface is charred, about 2 minutes per side. Less direct heat can be used for less charring, but the smoky bittersweet grill marks are a key part of the dish.</li>
                <li>Serve grilled chicken thighs on top of the sauce, with more sambal if desired.</li>
